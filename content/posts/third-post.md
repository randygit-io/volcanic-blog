"FIRE IN THE BORGO" BY PHILIP WALLEN

luke-warm mush, then cold milk poured over it
chills and transforms the entire arrangement gradually
tending towards an ineradicable (nonbiodegradable)
plastic resembling "Bakelite," shiny brown
It shatters if you drop it hard

Changed again! Turned 180 degrees in an
Unexpected direction
Bent Beethoven, Burnt Njal I have lived
All these years until this moment
Without understanding there's absolutely nothing
Which I can do well
